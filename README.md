# ***L4D2-Tool***

*This is a tool made for the Valve game **Left 4 Dead 2**. It comes with some powerful features, including: mod pack sharing, addon management, VPK packer/unpacker, addon installer, addon subscription manager, responsive debug feedback, and customizable workshop paths. Hope you enjoy <3*  

*In this README I’ll explain how the features work and the approaches I took — some of which I think are pretty innovative and unique. I used some amazing packages, like **MoonSharp**, which made syntax handling and debugging for my script editor awesome.  
[Thanks xanathar for MoonSharp!](https://github.com/xanathar)*

#### ***NOTE: This is a private tool, but getting a key is free — all you need to do is contact `DestinyTakes` on Discord (`takenplace`) to see if you’re a good fit for testing. This will be released publicly after extensive testing of many features (mainly the cheat functions). This takes time because I’m working hard to make it completely undetectable.***
